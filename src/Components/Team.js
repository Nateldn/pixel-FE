                <p>From an early age I've been interested in technology and computing. I started my journey in tech with Code Nation in 2021 when I completed the Develop:Coding then the Develop:Cyber courses. These courses really kindled my interest in coding so attending the Master course was a natural progression. I am excited to start my career in IT, learn new skills and meet new people.</p>
                <p>Contributions to the project: creation of the framework, basic structure and styling of several pages, presentation</p>
